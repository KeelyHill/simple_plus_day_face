# Simple+Day, a Pebble Watch Face


I couldn't find the face I wanted, so I customized my own. It is based of Pebble's "Simplicity" example, and adds the day name(Sun-Sat) to my favorite Pebble watch face. It also moves the text up a little. #defines are added at the top of simplicity.c if I want to invert the colors.
